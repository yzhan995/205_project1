See report at project1_yuwei.pdf

### Compile

make

### Run
./npuzzle

#### If you want to modify the size of the puzzle, please modify the constant puzzle_size in npuzzle.cpp (e.g. puzzle_size=15)

#### The test result varies with the compiler and its version. My compiler used for this task is clang 14.0. If execution failed or make failed, you may remove the original npuzzle and re-make.
